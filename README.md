# Fénix REST copy

This project implements a fénix copy app, implemented in REST architecture with the databases implemented in SQL.

## Architecture

This app is divided into various Python files, in which there is an AdminUI and a ClientUI.

## Usage

When testing the StudentUI.py, please make sure to change the client_id and client_secret to match the ones from the fénix application. Also make sure to make the fénix application redirect link in the following format: "http://<your ipv4 adress>/callback"

Every Python script available must be executed for a well-functioning app
